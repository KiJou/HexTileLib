# HexTileLib
A simple library that contains some classes which help with creating Hexagonal Grids. 
This is a KISS approach, since many libs out there seemed bloated to me. 

Based on [Red Blob Games Guide to Hexagonal Grids.](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/)
Supports C# 8.0 as .Net Core 3.1 and .NetStandard2.0,
LGPLv3 Licensed.
